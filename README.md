# VHDL Counter Overflow Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential overflow bug in a simple VHDL counter.  The counter is designed to count from 0 to 15.  However, due to the potential for unexpected behavior in the clock or reset signals, `internal_count` may not be properly initialized and therefore the counter could overflow or exhibit other unexpected behaviors. This is a subtle bug that might be missed during initial testing.

## Bug Description:
The `buggy_counter.vhdl` file contains the buggy code. The issue lies in the lack of robust handling of potential initialization problems.  There's no explicit check for the `internal_count` signal exceeding its defined range which could lead to unexpected values.

## Solution:
The `fixed_counter.vhdl` file provides a corrected version of the counter. This solution adds a more robust reset mechanism to ensure correct initialization, reducing the risk of overflow. The improved solution addresses the initialization, preventing it from starting in an unexpected state.

## How to Reproduce:
1.  Simulate `buggy_counter.vhdl` using a VHDL simulator (e.g., ModelSim, GHDL).
2.  Observe the behavior of the `count` signal with various clock and reset patterns, focusing on edge cases and potential for unexpected states.
3.  Compare the results with the simulation of `fixed_counter.vhdl` to see the difference in behavior and the effectiveness of the fixes.
